# lightbox

A lightweight chat client for Squarespace.

## Getting Started

This doesn't have any CI yet, but it should eventually.

In the meantime, you'll need docker desktop running. Then, you can run `docker-compose up --build` in this directory to get things started.

## Developement Structure

TODO: This is in progress.
The file structure for this typescript application is as follows:

```
lightbox
└── web
│   └── src
│   │   └── main.tsx
│   └── dist
└── api
```

## TODO

- This needs unit tests.
- This documentation should be updated.
- The frontend is in need of chat components still.
